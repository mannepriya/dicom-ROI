# dicom-ROI
This repo contains notebooks with functions to process DICOM files.
You can convert the dicom images to numpy arrays and can view the Regions Of Interest(ROI)
You can also calculate the volume of the ROIs and the distance between two ROIs.
Hope this helps anyone who is working with DICOM files and wants to extract features for machine learning.
